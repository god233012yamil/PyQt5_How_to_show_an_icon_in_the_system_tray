# PyQt5_How_to_show_an_icon_in_the_system_tray
This code creates a tray icon for a PyQt5 application. It creates a QSystemTrayIcon object and sets a context menu with an "Exit" option that is connected to the close function of the parent. It also sets an icon for the tray icon. Finally, it shows the tray icon and runs the application.

You should replace 'myicon.ico' with the path to your .ico file. This icon will be displayed in the system tray.

Make sure that your system actually has a system tray, and that your OS settings allow applications to show system tray icons.

# What is the System Tray

“It is a special area on the desktop of Modern operating systems, called the system tray or notification area, where long-running applications can display icons and short messages”.

Here are some key advantages and reasons for using it:

1. User Experience: Some applications are meant to run in the background or don't need to be in the taskbar all the time. For these applications, a system tray icon can be less intrusive and more user-friendly.

2. Conservation of Screen Real Estate: By allowing the application to minimize to the system tray instead of the taskbar, you free up space on the taskbar, making for a cleaner and less cluttered workspace.

3. Quick Access and Control: QSystemTrayIcon can provide users with quick access to application controls and settings right from the system tray. This is especially useful for background applications, where users might want to change some settings or check the application status without opening the full application window.

4. Persistent Applications: For applications that need to remain open for extended periods (like antivirus software, chat clients, or system monitors), the use of a system tray icon can prevent accidental closure of the application and keep it running continuously in the background.

5. Notification System: QSystemTrayIcon can be used to deliver notifications to the user, even when the main application window isn't in focus. This is useful for updates, alerts, or other important information that needs to be communicated to the user.

In general, you should consider using QSystemTrayIcon if your application fits any of the above scenarios or if you think that system tray functionality will improve the user experience or functionality of your application.
